<p> This project unveils the relationship between wealth and local security levels in the U.S. in 7 charts sampled yearly from 2010, inspired by the “Worries of National Security” claimed by its ex-president Trump. It is presented in logical order and will discuss the production lastly. </p>

<h3> Overview </h3>
<!--Project chart1 -->
<div class="chart" id="pchart1" style = "width: 400px;">
      <script>
        var pchart1 = "pchart1.json";
        vegaEmbed('#pchart1', pchart1);
      </script>
</div>
      
      <p>
            Despite minor fluctuations, in the past decade, the U.S. national medium household income increased where offenses also dropped. However, this could be led by factors such as wealth (directly / indirectly) or policies. Therefore, we will investigate if household income impacted on a main source of local security – police forces.
      </p>
     <h3> Main </h3>
<!--Project chart2 -->
<div class="chart" id="pchart2" style = "width: 850px;">
      <script>
        var pchart2 = "pchart2.json";
        vegaEmbed('#pchart2', pchart2);
      </script>
</div>
      
      <p>
            Though states’ medium household incomes had risen overall, the local employed policemen remain at similar levels. As such, household income may not directly impact on the number of local policemen as well as the local security level but indirectly. To further understand the decline in crime cases, where states behaved similarly in Fig2, 3 states with characteristics of most states’ were selected to inspect closely. Those characteristics are according to 1) Regions 2) Level of fluctuations (Texas) and steadiness (New York) of police employed 3) Beyond average number of police deployed (California)
      </p>

  
<!--Project chart3 -->
<div class="chart" id="pchart3" style = "width: 490px; height: 390px">
      <script>
        var pchart3 = "pchart3.json";
        vegaEmbed('#pchart3', pchart3);
      </script>
</div>
      
      <p>
            Similar to the previous figure, the increase in income did not simply imply that every person is protected by more policemen. Therefore, security level may not solely due to the number of police per population but of other factors. On the other hand, since the level of employed police in California increased while other 2 states fluctuated, we wonder whether the number of employed police had little effect comparing to alternative factors if the level of safety changed.
      </p>

<!--Project chart4 -->
<div class="chart" id="pchart4" style = "width: 610px;">
      <script>
        var pchart4 = "pchart4.json";
        vegaEmbed('#pchart4', pchart4);
      </script>
</div>
      
      <p>
            As the number of offenses increased slightly in California accompanied with a drop in other 2 states, the effect of the employed police in California could have less impacts than other factors by its increasing number of cases; whereas the decrease and fluctuation in offenses of Texas and New York indicate the contribution of other factors to the local safety as both their offenses and arrested dropped over time. 
      </p>

 <!--Project chart5 -->
<div class="chart" id="pchart5" style = "width: 610px;">
      <script>
        var pchart5 = "pchart5.json";
        vegaEmbed('#pchart5', pchart5);
      </script>
</div>
      
      <p>
            In addition, as the number of arrests trend negatively in all 3 states, despite the limited effect of the employed police in California, the number of police deployed contributed to the safe also with other factors.
      </P>
<br>

 <!--Project chart7 -->
<div class="chart" id="pchart7" style = "width: 460px;">
      <script>
        var pchart7 = "pchart7.json";
        vegaEmbed('#pchart7', pchart7);
      </script>
</div>
     </br>
<p> Finally, even though the national level of offenses is trending downward with the above analysis, it is still insufficient to draw assumptions for all states as they could have opposite effects between their household income and number of crimes.
</p>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> Despite the missing of the direct link between the number of employed policemen and the improved in household income, the data provided evidences that the indirect positive effects could be deduced through people’s behaviors and become less eager to crimes, for example to steal, when their living standards have improved.

<h3> Data </h3>
<p> This project uses data from 2 API sources: the Federal Crime Explorer and the Federal Economic Reserve.
Python is used for data scaping, cleaning and dataset rebuilding. The accessibility of the APIs is first confirmed as <b> code 200 </b> as accessible before creating loops to access data using the <b> format </b> method from the <b> requests </b> and <b> json </b> library. Loops within other loops are also applied to recreate new sets of data. 
</p)
<p><br><br>
At last, with the desired sections selected, dataframes were created with the <b> Pandas</b> library and exported as json and csv files. Data is then cleaned with the<b> drop</b> and <b>replace </b>method to eliminate abnormalities and reproduced new dataset of desired combinations and modifications of the data.

<h3> Conclusion for the project </h3>
<p> Personally, this project is challenging but highly rewarded as I can apply every aspect from what we learnt and to open-up and discuss with our professors and peers.   </p>
